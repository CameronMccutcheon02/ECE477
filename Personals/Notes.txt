*** Notes on PCB Assembly ***
- potential considerations
    - exposed copper by pin 1 of U2
    - pin1 and pin2 bridged of U2, but shouldnt cause any issues
    - via with solder by C2
    - PB8 on micro / motor enable 2 looks cut off
    - solder under R7? is that an issue, i can't tell if there is acually solder under there
