*** Notes on PCB Assembly ***
- systems soldered to this point
    - barrel jack power 
    - LDO power
    - USB - UART io
- systems to solder
    - sw1
    - connectors
    - u5 (motor level)
    - u6 (7 seg)

- potential considerations
    - exposed copper by pin 1 of U2
    - pin1 and pin2 bridged of U2, but shouldnt cause any issues
    - via with solder by C2
