-------------- WEEK 10 PROGRESS ------------- 
Notes:
- motor control
    - made function run_motors(pulses), called when motor_flag = 1
    - 400 steps / revolution @ 1 Khz clock -> 1000 pulses per second
    - send in the number of pulses. 400 pulses = 1 revolution, 800 pulses = 2 revolutions
    - joey's code outputs roughly in a range of (-10, 300) so that worked well with pulsing
    - want to look into a better way of implementing this -> there is deviation over time
        - we are just using HAL_TIM_Start and stop for HAL_Delay ms. 
        - looking into using RCR with timers and interrupts to improve precision
        - https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus-products/how-to-use-rcr-to-produce-a-fixed-amount-of-pwm-pulses/td-p/192555 
    - TIM1 -> ARR = 200, CCR1 = 100, time = pulses * .2 | fast reaction speed

To-do:
- look into e-stop motors for 24 vdc
- use parts list to organize parts and work area
- re-print new funnel design
- practice soldering
- ask cameron abt uart connector
- submit another purchase request
    - 5V barrel jack power supply
    - linear rail 
    - limit switches
----------- WEEK 7 PROGRESS ------------- 
-------- UPDATES --------
- ir interfacing done 
- serial comms prototyped w LEDs
    - 0b11111111 << 4
    - PC interfacing with stm is working great -> i can use teraterm to write a value and STM reads, parses, and uses it to control output LEDs. when i do the same thring with pyserial, it is quite delayed and i think the data is being sent separately. overall working good but need to debug pyserial issue

-------- NOTES --------
- IR interfacing    
    - using timer1, EXTI4_15_IRQ
    - wrote callback function to increment player 1 and 2 scores whenever IR triggered (HAL_GPIO_EXTI_Callback)
        - print to terminal over usart
        - GPIO configs: GPIO pins 10 and 11 for player 1 and 2 score interrupts, init on falling (GPIO_MODE_IT_FALLING), had to use pull_up resistors otherwise doesn't work. 
        - referenced in stm32f0xx_hal_gpio.c in HAL_GPIO_EXTI_IRQHandler, which has gpio pin as argument and clears the interupt before calling the callback function. this handler is clld in EXTI4_15_IRQHandler in stm32f0xx_it.c
- serial comms
    - i can send an 8-bit packet from PC/python to control the corresponding LEDs 
        - converting a byte packet to an int was a bit complicated in C, so i accept an 8-bit packet in python, convert it to a string of the integer version, and then use sscanf() in C to convert a string to an int
        - i had to ensure that the same size string is always being sent

-------- PLAN --------
* Determine which pins for what 
* Look over PCB design
* Update funnel design so puck doesn't get stuck
* update website
- To-do:
    - Website updates
        - add all assignments / Reports (update if grade warrents)
        - add all data sheets
        - add PCB
        - presentation slides 
    - print camera mount
    - redesign puck funnels

-------------- WEEK 6 PROGRESS ------------- 
-------- UPDATES --------
- IR sensors working in STM32Cube and blinking LED / sending serial output whenever beam is broken
    - need to improve by implementing interrupts, currently polling. using GPIOA
    - using HAL
- IR sensors are in and i tested and verified with an Arduino script -> they work up to 8 in. away which is max what we would need

-------- NOTES --------
