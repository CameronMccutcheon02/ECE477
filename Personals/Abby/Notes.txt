-------------- WEEK 8/9 PROGRESS ------------- 
-------- UPDATES --------
- fixed serial comms issue and am done with that for the time being
- updated ir sensors to be PB6-7, still EXTI4_15
- 3D printed iterations of camera mount
- 3d printed puck idk why tho tbh
- control motor directions with data sent from PC
- progress with 7seg and stm    
    - tim2
    - full-duplex master mode spi 
    - verified SPI works w selected pins, but not yet w 7seg. power issues - working with john
    - tested with test code, sending off to john
- ordered ICs to be in by Thurs
- merged code to one project and pushed to Github
-------- TO-DO --------
- interface 7seg w stm (in progress)
- submit moonshot pitch 
- submit procurement order for gantry
-------- NOTES --------
