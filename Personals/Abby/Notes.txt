-------------- SENDING DATA FROM PC ------------- 
- Code contained in serial_write.py 

Potential dependencies for serial communication 
- infi.devicemanager (https://pypi.org/project/infi.devicemanager/)
- pyusb
- libusb

-Potential CLI implementation of RealTerm or TeraTerm (https://realterm.sourceforge.io/#Command_Line_Parameters)
-------------- RECEIVING DATA ON STM -------------- 
- Created project in STM32Cube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kUo-ekxmCA)
Settings:
    - Cleared all pinouts
    - Set high speed clock under RCC to Crystal/Ceramic Resonator
    - Enabled aysnch USART 2 with enabled global interrupt and 9600 baud rate
    - Added circular DMA USART2_RX so mem doesn't fill up
    - Installed STSW-LINK007 to update ST-Link adapter FW

- I'm using TeraTerm to open the serial connection on COM3.
- Using built in HAL_UART_Receive function  
- Reading serial data(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kUo-ekxmCA timestamp 8 min)
- DMA over receiving UART
- RealTerm app is used to send serial data to test reading on the STM behalf (serial capture program)

-------------- DIMENSIONS for CAD (mm) -------------- 
- score board extenders
54.31 outter diameter
49.05 inner diameter
54.47 gole diameter
43.40 length

- camera 
38.08 x 38.08 
16.75 mm to cable

-------------- TO-DO -------------- 
- Read serial data on STM
- Send data from PC
- 3D print score board extenders
- 3D print camera holder
