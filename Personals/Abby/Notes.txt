-------------- WEEK 13 PROGRESS ------------- 
Notes:
- 7 segment display progress
    - we have an issue with the LED driver or with the code
        - when i try to turn off the larger segments, they remain powered with ~ 3V. i can power off the smaller segments, but something is leaving the larger segments powered. 
            - this has interfered with 7seg progress because i cannot control one display at a time due to the larger segments remaining powered
                - john will help me tues
    - we realized that the pull up resistors do not actually solve the original problem - so we need to switch our method
        - we will either use John's PCB 
        - i am going to prototype with just HC595s and have it dim so i can write the code
- main PCB  
    - soldered other headers and reset button
    - uploaded code to run two motors
    - soldered extenders to IR sensors
    - attached motor wires to connectors

- hours
    - mon: 2
        - 7 segment and 3d printing
        - 3d printed better L brackets
        - updated stm script for 7 segment
    - tues: 5
        - soldered, wiring/packaging, pcb, code
    - wed: 4
        - wired underneath table, got motors running off of pcb
    - thurs: 4
        - went to jordan's office, emailed him and made a plan. emailed Angela to figure out where our spot will be
        - finish soldering pcb and headers
        - soldered a UART protoboard to connect to main pcb
        - uploaded looped code to have robot move back and forth
    - fri: 2

To-do:
- integrate 7 segment with stm (by wed)
- ask jordan about moving table for spark challenge (tues)
- update website (thurs)
