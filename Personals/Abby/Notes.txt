RECEIVING DATA ON STM
- Created project in STM32Cube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kUo-ekxmCA)
Settings:
    - Cleared all pinouts
    - Set high speed clock under RCC to Crystal/Ceramic Resonator
    - Enabled aysnch USART 2 with enabled global interrupt and 9600 baud rate
    - Added circular DMA USART2_RX so mem doesn't fill up
- I'm using TeraTerm to open the serial connection on COM3.
- Using built in HAL_UART_Receive function  
- Reading serial data(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kUo-ekxmCA timestamp 8 min)

3D PRINTING
- Design .stl files for score board height extenders
- Design .stl file for a mount to anchor the camera to the scoreboard
