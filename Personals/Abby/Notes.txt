-------------- WEEK 10 PROGRESS ------------- 
Notes:
- motor control
    - made function run_motors(pulses), called when motor_flag = 1
    - 400 steps / revolution @ 1 Khz clock -> 1000 pulses per second
    - send in the number of pulses. 400 pulses = 1 revolution, 800 pulses = 2 revolutions
    - joey's code outputs roughly in a range of (-10, 300) so that worked well with pulsing
    - want to look into a better way of implementing this -> there is deviation over time
        - we are just using HAL_TIM_Start and stop for HAL_Delay ms. 
        - looking into using RCR with timers and interrupts to improve precision
        - https://community.st.com/t5/stm32-mcus-products/how-to-use-rcr-to-produce-a-fixed-amount-of-pwm-pulses/td-p/192555 
    - TIM1 -> ARR = 200, CCR1 = 100, time = pulses * .2 | fast reaction speed

To-do:
- look into e-stop motors for 24 vdc
- use parts list to organize parts and work area
- re-print new funnel design
- practice soldering
- ask cameron abt uart connector
- submit another purchase request
    - 5V barrel jack power supply
    - linear rail 
    - limit switches
